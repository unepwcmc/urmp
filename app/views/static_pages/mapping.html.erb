    In order to apply REDD+ safeguards, and more broadly address the challenge of optimal decision making in the face of multiple risks and opportunities, countries will need to understand the risks and opportunities  associated with different REDD+ options when implemented in different parts of the landscape. Carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem servicies are unevenly distributed across the landscape and the costs of maintaining them will therefore vary.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help countries decide where to locate their REDD+ activities, five processes are described below that will enable countries to carry out robust, informed decision making. Tools are highlighted where relevant which may assist with or simplify a  process a country undertaking.
  </p>

  <h3>Process</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Identify national priorities, such as existing environmental goals or those set for REDD+
    </li>
    <li>
      Map indicator data which represents these priorities. The UN-REDD mapping manual and associated Exploring Multiple Benefits tool can assist in mapping carbon and bringing it together with other relevant data <LINK>
    </li>
    <li>
      Assess potential for and cost of different REDD+ interventions in different areas
    </li>
    <li>
      Economic valuation of risks and benefits, and alternative approaches. An analysis of how value could be attached to risks and benefits is described in the following paper <LINK>
    </li>
  </ol>
