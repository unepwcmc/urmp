        intro:

<p>
The main purpose of REDD+ is to mitigate global climate change. REDD+ also has the potential 
to deliver other benefits, both environmental and social, to countries that choose to 
implement it. This website offers an overview of steps that can be taken to ensure that 
REDD+ delivers benefits and that risks are reduced, covering three areas: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href='/safeguards'>Applying REDD+ Safeguards</a></li>
<li><a href='/monitoring'>Assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services</a></li>
<li><a href='/assessment'>Monitoring the impacts of REDD+ on biodiversity and ecosystem services</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
It also includes a library of <a href='/resources'>tools and resources</a>, with descriptions of their relevance to 
REDD+ planning or implementation.  The website is intended to assist REDD+ planners, 
policy makers and their technical advisors, especially those working on REDD+ strategies, 
land-use planning for REDD+, and the implementation of the UNFCCCâ€™s <a href='/faq#cancun-safeguards'>Cancun safeguards</a>.

<p>
Forests provide a range of <a href='/faq#biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services'>ecosystem services</a>, 
and host the biodiversity that underpins these services. The services provided by any particular 
forest may include climate change mitigation, water regulation, cultural benefits, and production 
of food, fuel or fibre. REDD+ actions can protect or enhance these services by preventing loss or 
degradation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity, or restoring forest ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
Forests vary in their importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, and also in their 
likely response to forest management actions. The benefits and risks of REDD+ will thus depend 
on the location and type of REDD+ actions. Planning approaches to reduce risks and promote 
benefits may include: identifying priorities for benefits, putting safeguard policies in place, 
identifying risks and benefits that may arise from specific actions and selecting locations for 
these that secure high-priority benefits with low risks. The UN-REDD Programme supports 
countries in their efforts to integrate this thinking into their REDD+ strategies and development
plans.

      <p>
        The UN-REDD Programme currently supports 48 partner countries
        across Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean.
        Many of these countries are developing approaches to ensure that
        their plans for REDD+ take account of the potential risks and
        opportunities for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Recent
        outputs are available below.
