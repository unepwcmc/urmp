<p>
REDD+ has the potential to bring <a href='/faq#multiple-benfits'>multiple
benefits</a>, both environmental and social, to countries that choose to
implement it, including its main purpose of mitigating global climate change.
<strong>This website offers a guide to resources that can help to ensure that
REDD+ delivers environmental benefits and that environmental risks are
reduced.</strong> It aims to assist REDD+ planners, policy makers and their
technical advisors, especially those working on REDD+ strategies, land-use
planning for REDD+, and the implementation of the UNFCCCâ€™s

<p>
Forests provide a range of <a href='/faq#biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services'>ecosystem services</a>, and host the
biodiversity that underpins these services. Ecosystem services include
climate change mitigation, water regulation, cultural benefits, and
production of food, fuel and fibre. When REDD+ actions prevent loss or
degradation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity, or improve their
condition, multiple benefits will result, including protected or
enhanced ecosystem services.
</p>

<p> Ecosystem services and biodiversity of different forests vary, and they
will also respond differently to forest management actions. What environmental
benefits and risks that may result from REDD+ will therefore depend on the
location and type of REDD+ actions undertaken. National planning approaches
may include: deciding what benefits are prioritized, putting safeguard
policies in place, identifying risks and benefits that may arise from proposed
actions and allocating REDD+ actions to locations that secure priority
benefits at low risk. The UN-REDD Programme supports countries in their
efforts to integrate these considerations into their REDD+ strategies and
development plans.

      <p>
        The UN-REDD Programme currently supports 46 partner countries
        across Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean.
        Many of these countries are developing approaches to ensure that
        their plans for REDD+ take account of the potential risks and
        opportunities for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Recent
        outputs are available below. On-going work is highlighted here.
