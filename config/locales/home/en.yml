REDD+ has the potential to bring <a href='/faq#multiple-benfits'>multiple
benefits</a>, both environmental and social, to countries that choose to
implement it, including its main purpose of mitigating global climate change.
<strong>This website offers a guide to resources that can help to ensure that
REDD+ delivers environmental benefits and that environmental risks are
reduced.</strong> It aims to assist REDD+ planners, policy makers and their
technical advisors, especially those working on REDD+ strategies, land-use
planning for REDD+, and the implementation of the UNFCCCâ€™s  <a href='/faq
#cancun-safeguards'>Cancun safeguards</a>.
</p>

<p>
Forests provide a range of <a href='/faq#biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services'>ecosystem services</a>, and host the
biodiversity that underpins these services. Ecosystem services include
climate change mitigation, water regulation, cultural benefits, and
production of food, fuel and fibre. When REDD+ actions prevent loss or
degradation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity, or improve their
condition, multiple benefits will result, including protected or
enhanced ecosystem services.
</p>

<p> Ecosystem services and biodiversity of different forests vary, and they
will also respond differently to forest management actions. What environmental
benefits and risks that may result from REDD+ will therefore depend on the
location and type of REDD+ actions undertaken. National planning approaches
may include: deciding what benefits are prioritized, putting safeguard
policies in place, identifying risks and benefits that may arise from proposed
actions and allocating REDD+ actions to locations that secure priority
benefits at low risk. The UN-REDD Programme supports countries in their
efforts to integrate these considerations into their REDD+ strategies and
development plans.

<strong>On this site, you can find a guide to key tools in three areas for which the UN-REDD Programme provides support:</strong><br>
1) <a href='/safeguards'>Applying REDD+ safeguards</a>, 2) <a href='/assessment'>Identification, mapping and valuation of environmental risks</a> and
benefits and 3) <a href='/monitoring'>Monitoring REDD+ impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services</a>. Furthermore,
you can <a href='/search'>search</a> a library of tools and resources that have been identified as relevant to REDD+
safeguards or multiple benefits. A collection of <a href='/factsheets'>factsheets</a> provides more detailed information on
selected tools.
