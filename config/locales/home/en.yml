Decision support on biodiversity and ecosystem services under REDD+
</p>

<p>
The REDD+ mechanism has the potential to bring multiple benefits, both environmental and social,
to countries that choose to implement it, in addition to its main purpose of mitigating global climate
change. This website offers a guide to resources that can help to ensure that REDD+ delivers
environmental benefits and that environmental risks are reduced. It aims to assist REDD+ planners,
policy makers and their technical advisors, especially those working on REDD+ strategies, land-use
planning for REDD+, and the implementation of the UNFCCCâ€™s Cancun safeguards.
</p>

<p>
Forests provide a range of ecosystem services, and host the biodiversity that underpins these
services. Ecosystem services include carbon sequestration, water and local climatic regulation,
cultural benefits, and production of food, fuel and fibre. When actions under the REDD+ mechanism
prevents loss or degradation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity, or improves their condition,
multiple benefits will result, including protected or enhanced ecosystem services.
</p>

<p>
Ecosystem services and biodiversity of different forests vary, and they will also respond differently to
forest management actions. What environmental benefits and risks that may result from REDD+ in
a forest will therefore depend on the location and type of REDD+ actions undertaken. Implementing
REDD+ thus requires an investment in planning by countries, to balance different national objectives,
decide what benefits are prioritized, and identify risks that may arise from proposed actions. The
UN-REDD Programme supports countries in their efforts to integrate multiple benefit considerations
into their REDD+ strategies and development plans.

<p>
On this site, you can find a guide to key tools in three areas for which UN-REDD provide support:<br>
1) Applying REDD+ safeguards, 2) Identification, mapping and valuation of environmental risks and
benefits and 3) Monitoring REDD+ impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Furthermore,
you can search a library of tools and resources that have been identified as relevant to REDD+
safeguards or multiple benefits. A collection of factsheets provides more detailed information on
selected tools.
