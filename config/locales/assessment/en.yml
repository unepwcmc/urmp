 <a href='/faq#biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services'>Biodiversity and ecosystem services</a>, including carbon stocks, are generally distributed unevenly over a landscape. A land-use decision in one place is likely to have effects elsewhere. In order to choose among REDD+ options and decide where they should be implemented, countries will need to understand the risks and opportunities associated with applying the different REDD+ options, and how they will affect safeguards and multiple benefits when applied in different places.

      Identify national priorities, including existing environmental goals, development goals, and targets set for REDD+. REDD+ influences not only the forestry sector, but a range of other national priorities as well, including rural development and biodiversity targets.

      <p>
        The sections of <a href='/resources/12'>BeRT</a> that cover Principle 4 of the UN-REDD <a href='/resources/46'>Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria (SEPC)</a> may assist in developing actions that address these goals coherently.

      Quantify and map indicator data which represents these priorities. The <a href='http://www.un-redd.org/Multiple_Benefits_GIS_Mapping_Toolbox/tabid/79198/Default.aspx'>ExploringMultipleBenefits toolbox and mapping manual</a> can assist in mapping carbon and bringing it together with other relevant data on biodiversity and multiple benefits, to inform land use planning and decision making for REDD+.

      Assess potential for and cost of different REDD+ interventions in different areas, including transaction, implementation and opportunity costs.

        The <a href='/resources/38'>REDD Abacus Software</a>, developed by the World Agroforestry Centre, analyzes the opportunity costs of land use change in a landscape.

      Conduct economic valuation of risks, benefits, and alternative approaches to deciding on priorities. For example, this paper, <a href='http://www.bioecon-network.org/pages/14th_2012/Narloch.pdf'>Towards a holistic assessment of national REDD+ options: Accounting for ecosystem service and biodiversity impacts</a>, describes how an economic assessment of REDD+ options including its benefits and risks from impacts on non-carbon ecosystems services and biodiversity can be undertaken.

      Identify the potential for enhancing multiple benefits and minimizing trade-offs when undertaking REDD+ activities.

      <p>
        <a href='/resources/11'>Marxan</a> is a land-use planning tool developed for conservation purposes, which may also be applied in a REDD+ context. It can be used to identify cost-effective spatial solutions that attain a number of targets (such as reducing carbon emissions, conserving biodiversity and protecting or restoring areas important for ecosystem services).
