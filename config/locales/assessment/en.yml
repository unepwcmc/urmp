 <a href='/faq#biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services'>Biodiversity and ecosystem services</a>, including carbon stocks, are generally distributed unevenly over a landscape. A land-use decision in one place is likely to have effects elsewhere. In order to choose among REDD+ options and decide where they should be implemented, countries will need to understand the risks and opportunities associated with applying the different REDD+ options, and how they will affect safeguards and multiple benefits when applied in different places.
</p>
<p>
Five activities are described below that, individually or in combination, can help countries to carry out robust, informed decision making on REDD+ interventions. Particularly relevant tools and other resources are highlighted. Further relevant tools can be found through the search links at the bottom of this page.

      <strong>Identify national priorities</strong>, including existing environmental goals, development goals, and targets set for REDD+. REDD+ influences not only the forestry sector, but a range of other national priorities as well, including rural development and biodiversity targets.

      <p>
        The sections of <a href='/resources/12'>BeRT</a> that cover Principle 4 of the UN-REDD <a href='/resources/46'>Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria (SEPC)</a> may assist in developing interventions that address these goals coherently.

      <strong>Quantify and map indicator data</strong> which represents these priorities. The <a href='http://www.un-redd.org/Multiple_Benefits_GIS_Mapping_Toolbox/tabid/79198/Default.aspx'>ExploringMultipleBenefits toolbox and mapping manual</a> can assist in mapping carbon and bringing it together with other relevant data on biodiversity and multiple benefits, to inform land use planning and decision making for REDD+.

      <strong>Assess potential for and cost of different REDD+ interventions</strong> in different areas, including transaction, implementation and opportunity costs.

      <p>
        Map areas suitable for different interventions on the basis of current
        land uses, designations, and the safeguards. These maps can be combined
        with the indicators to produce decision support material on the
        potential for REDD+ interventions to deliver multiple benefits.

      Conduct <strong>economic valuation</strong> of risks, benefits, and alternative approaches to deciding on priorities. For example, this paper, <a href='http://www.bioecon-network.org/pages/14th_2012/Narloch.pdf'>Towards a holistic assessment of national REDD+ options: Accounting for ecosystem service and biodiversity impacts</a>, describes how an economic assessment of REDD+ interventions including its benefits and risks from impacts on non-carbon ecosystem services and biodiversity can be undertaken.

        <a href='/resources/11'>Marxan</a> is a land-use planning tool developed for conservation purposes, which may also be applied in a REDD+ context. It can be used to identify cost-effective spatial solutions that attain a number of targets (such as reducing carbon emissions, conserving biodiversity and protecting or restoring areas important for ecosystem services).
