    Biodiversity and ecosystem services, including carbon stocks, are generally distributed unevenly over
    a landscape, due to the spatial variability of the social and biophysical processes which affect their
    abundance and distribution. A land-use decision in one place is likely to have effects elsewhere. In
    order to choose among REDD+ options and decide where they should be implemented, countries
    will need to understand the risks and opportunities associated with applying the different REDD+
    options, and how they will affect safeguards and multiple benefits in different parts of a landscape,
    a country or a region. Land use planning tools applied together with adequate data can inform
    decision making in this respect.

    Five activities are described below that can help countries to carry out robust, informed decision
    making. Particularly relevant tools and other resources which may be of use in these activities are
    highlighted. Further information about tools that are relevant for the different processes can be
    found through the search links at the bottom of this page.

    Assessment activities:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identify national priorities, including existing environmental goals, development goals,
        and targets set for REDD+. REDD+ influences not only the forestry sector, but a range of
        other national priorities as well, including rural development and biodiversity targets.
        The sections of BeRT that cover Principle 4 of the SEPC may assist in bringing these
        different goals together, and develop actions that address them coherently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Map indicator data which represents these priorities. The UN-REDD mapping manual
        and associated Exploring Multiple Benefits toolbox can assist in mapping carbon and
        bringing it together with other relevant data on biodiversity and multiple benefits, to
        inform land use planning and decision making for REDD+.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assess potential for and cost of different REDD+ interventions in different areas.
        The REDD Abacus Software is one example that can be of use, which analyzes the
        opportunity costs of land use change in a landscape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conduct economic valuation of risks, benefits, and alternative approaches to deciding
        on priorities. For example, this paper describes how an economic assessment of REDD+
        options including its benefits and risks from impacts on non-carbon ecosystems services
        and biodiversity can be undertaken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify the potential for enhancing multiple benefits and minimize trade-offs with
        REDD+ activities. Marxan is a land-use planning tool developed for conservation
        purposes, which may also be applied in a REDD+ context. It can be used to identify cost-
        effective spatial solutions that attain a number of targets (such as reducing carbon
        emissions, conserving biodiversity and protecting or restoring areas important for
        ecosystem services).
