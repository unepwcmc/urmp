  <h4 id='biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services'>What are biodiversity and ecosystem services?</h4>
  <p>Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms. It includes diversity within and among species and diversity within and among ecosystems. Biodiversity is the source of many ecosystem goods, such as food and genetic resources, and changes in biodiversity can influence the supply of ecosystem services. <br><br>Ecosystem services are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food, fibre and water; regulating services such as flood and disease control; cultural services such as spiritual, recreational, and cultural benefits; and supporting services, such as nutrient cycling, which ensure the conditions that enable life on Earth. For more information, see the <a class='external-link' href='http://maweb.org/en/index.aspx'> Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a>.
  <h4 id='multiple-benefits'>What are multiple benefits?</h4>
  <p>The expression 'multiple benefits' encompasses all the benefits that will flow from a successful REDD+ mechanism. That is, it includes both the global climate mitigation benefits from REDD+ and the other environmental and social benefits. This is further discussed in <a class='external-link' href='http://unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=3199&Itemid=53'>Multiple Benefits Series 1</a>.<br><br>This website focuses on the environmental benefits that can result when REDD+ prevents loss or degradation of forests, or even improves their condition. These include biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services such as water regulation, soil conservation, timber, forest foods and other non-timber forest products. Various factors affect how the benefits attained, including the type, location and condition of the forest involved, which REDD+ activity is undertaken, how it is implemented, and the dependence of the local population on forest resources. The REDD+ mechanism also has the potential to yield social benefits, such as jobs, livelihoods, land tenure clarification, carbon payments, and enhanced participation in decision-making and improved governance.</p>
  <h4 id='cancun-safeguards'>What are the Cancun safeguards?</h4>
  <p>REDD+ has the potential to deliver substantial benefits beyond carbon. However, depending on how REDD+ is implemented, there is also a possibility that risks will be incurred, for example conversion of natural forest to plantations, or displacement or loss of livelihoods for local people. The Cancun safeguards (<a class='external-link' href='http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf'>Paragraphs 69, 71d, 72, 76 and Appendix I in the UNFCCC Decision 1/CP.16</a>) were agreed by Parties to the UNFCCC at COP 16 in Cancun in 2010 to address such risks. Parties agreed to promote and support these safeguards. Further details were agreed at UNFCCC COP 17 in Durban 2011 (<a class='external-link' href='http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a02.pdf#page=16'>Decision 12/CP.17</a>)</p>
  <h4 id='safguards-and-multiple-benefits'>How do safeguards and multiple benefits relate in the context of REDD+?</h4>
  <p>One reason that countries may wish to plan for multiple benefits from REDD+ is that it helps to promote and support the Cancun safeguards, which state, among other things, that [REDD+] 'actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the actions referred to in paragraph 70 of this decision are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits' (<a class='external-link' href='http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf'>COP16, FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1.para 2(e))</a>.</p>
  <h4 id='SEPC-and-safeguards'>How do the UN-REDD Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria (SEPC) relate to the Cancun safeguards?</h4>
  <p>One of the purposes of the SEPC is to support countries in developing national approaches to REDD+ safeguards. The SEPC are consistent with UNFCCC agreements on safeguards for REDD+, and can, in combination with other tools and approaches, help countries to develop national approaches for promoting, supporting and building on the Cancun safeguards, providing information on how the Cancun safeguards are being addressed and respected, and demonstrating achievements beyond carbon (e.g. with respect to poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation).</p>
  <h4 id='guidance-frameworks'>Can several guidance frameworks for interpreting and implementing the Cancun safeguards be used simultaneously (e.g. FCPF SESA, UN-REDD SEPC, REDD+ SES)?</h4>
  <p>The Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) used by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) of the World Bank, the Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria (SEPC) developed by the UN-REDD Programme, and the REDD+ Social & Environmental Standards (REDD+ SES) can all guide countries in developing a national approach to REDD+ safeguards. FCPF REDD+ countries are required to undertake a SESA, while the UN-REDD SEPC is a guiding framework. REDD+ SES is a civil society initiative and hence also voluntary. Applying more than one framework at a time is possible, though countries will need to determine whether it is beneficial in their particular case. <a class='external-link' href='http://forestcarbonasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/FCA-SNV_BioREDD_Brief-270612.pdf'>Swan et al. 2012</a> propose three possible starting points for an in-country multi-stakeholder safeguards process, and elaborate further on this question.</p>
  <h4 id='REDD-strategies'>Is capacity building available on developing a national approach to safeguards, or including multiple benefits in REDD+ strategies?</h4>
  <p>The UN-REDD Programme is currently providing direct support to a number of countries on these topics, through targeted support funding, as well as under National Programmes. <br>Targeted support can be requested by partner countries of the UN-REDD Programme which are undertaking REDD+ efforts with a view to design and implement a national REDD+ strategy or action plan (see <a class='external-link' href='http://unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=6755&Itemid=53'>Procedures for requesting UN-REDD Programme Targeted Support</a>).</p>
