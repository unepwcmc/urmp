  Monitoring impacts of REDD+ activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services is key for generating information needed to reverse destructive trends and enhance multiple benefits through REDD+. As part of the <a href='http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf#page=26'>Cancun Agreements</a> of the UNFCCC, countries are requested to develop a Safeguards Information System that can provide information on how safeguards are being addressed and respected. The UNFCCC decisions do not mention monitoring in this context. However, countries may choose to develop and implement a monitoring system that is able to track both positive and negative impacts of REDD+ on biodiversity and ecosystem services. This would help countries to demonstrate that environmental safeguards are being promoted and supported, and provide input for a safeguard information system.

  When developing a programme for monitoring the impacts of REDD+ on ecosystem services and biodiversity, the following issues are relevant:
  <ul>
    <li>
      What aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem services will be measured, and in what way? When monitoring REDD+ impacts, it may be useful to aim for a combination of different types of data. Remotely sensed data can provide wall-to-wall information on land use and land cover changes, which is of great relevance to assessing environmental impacts of REDD+. Data collected through ground-based forest and biodiversity surveys can add detail about changes that cannot be detected remotely. Participatory biodiversity monitoring (PBM) can play an important role, drawing on local knowledge, and involving stakeholders directly in REDD+.
    </li>
    <li>
      Objectives of biodiversity monitoring schemes need to be clearly defined to ensure that the indicators, approaches and protocols for data collection, data management and data quality assurance selected meet these objectives. This can include monitoring of the state of biodiversity, pressures on biodiversity and what REDD+ measures have been implemented to safeguard biodiversity. Objectives also need to consider the spatial variability of biodiversity and how to attribute changes in patterns and abundance of species to REDD+ activities. It is important that an appropriate range of stakeholders are engaged early in the process of development of objectives, to ensure that stakeholders, local tenure system, potential incentives for monitoring, and monitoring costs have been considered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Systems for monitoring impacts of REDD+ activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services should, ideally, build upon and complement other existing monitoring schemes, to allow best use of limited resources, acknowledge existing institutions and allow comparability of datasets as much as possible, while still serving its purpose. The development of a monitoring system to serve a national REDD+ programme presents a number of operational and methodological issues. The UN-REDD Programme has provided some guidance on these in <a href='/resources/18'>DRAFT: Guidelines for monitoring the impacts of REDD+ on biodiversity and ecosystem services</a>.
