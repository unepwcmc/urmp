  Monitoring impacts of REDD+ activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services is key for generating
  information needed to reverse destructive trends and enhance multiple benefits through REDD+.
  As part of the Cancun Agreements of the UNFCCC, countries are requested to develop a <i>Safeguards
  Information System</i> that can provide information on how safeguards are being addressed and
  respected. Choosing to develop and implement a monitoring system that is able to track both
  positive and negative impacts of REDD+ on biodiversity and ecosystem services can help countries to
  demonstrate that environmental safeguards are being promoted and supported, and provide input
  for a safeguard information system.

  When developing a programme for monitoring the impacts of REDD+ on ecosystem services and
  biodiversity, the following are some activities that are relevant to consider:
  <ul>
    <li>
      What aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem services will be measured, and in what way?
      When monitoring REDD+ impacts, it may be useful to aim for a combination of different
      types of data. Remotely sensed data can provide wall-to-wall information on land use and
      land cover changes, which is of great relevance to assessing environmental impacts of
      REDD+. Data collected through ground-based forest and biodiversity surveys can add detail
      about changes that cannot be detected remotely. Participatory biodiversity monitoring
      (PBM) can play an important role in national REDD+ programmes, to draw on local
      knowledge, and involve stakeholders.
    </li> 
    <li>
      Objectives of biodiversity monitoring schemes need to be clearly defined to ensure that
      the indicators, approaches and protocols for data collection, data management and data
      quality assurance selected meet these objectives. This can include monitoring of the state of
      biodiversity, pressures on biodiversity and what REDD+ activities have been implemented to
      safeguard biodiversity. Objectives also need to consider the spatial variability of biodiversity
      and how to attribute changes in patterns and abundance of species to REDD+ activities. It
      is important that an appropriate range of stakeholders are engaged early in the process
      of development of objectives, to ensure that stakeholders, local tenure system, potential
      incentives for monitoring, and monitoring costs have been considered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Systems for monitoring impacts of REDD+ activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services
      should, ideally, build upon and complement other existing monitoring schemes, to allow
      best use of limited resources, acknowledge existing institutions and allow comparability
      of datasets as much as possible, while still serving its purpose. The development of a
      monitoring system to serve a national REDD+ programme presents a number of operational
      and methodological considerations. The UN-REDD Programme provides guidance on these
      considerations as part of the   &ldquo;DRAFT: Guidelines for monitoring the impacts of REDD+ on
      biodiversity and ecosystem services &rdquo;.
