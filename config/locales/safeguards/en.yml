  In the <a href='http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf'>&ldquo;Cancun Agreements&rdquo;</a> of 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed a set of social and
  environmental safeguards to be supported and promoted by countries that implement REDD+ activities. Doing so may require countries to develop new policies, laws and regulations. Parties also agreed that countries should set up a national safeguards information system that is able to provide information on how the safeguards are being addressed. Provision of summary information would be made periodically in National Communications to the UNFCCC. Details on such Safeguards Information Systems (SIS) were further elaborated at COP 17 in <a href='http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a02.pdf#page=16'>Durban</a> 2011.

<p>
The UN-REDD Programme has developed a set of <a href='/resources/46'>Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria
(SEPC)</a> as a guiding framework consistent with the Cancun Agreements, to:
  <ol>
    <li>
      To  address social and environmental issues in the UN-REDD National Programmes and other UN-REDD founded activities
    </li>
    <li>
      To support countries in developing national approaches to safeguards in line with the decisions made under the UNFCCC
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  A first and crucial step in developing a REDD+ safeguards approach is to
  clearly define its objectives. This entails interpreting what is contained in
  the UNFCCC decisions from the country perspective, and considering the specific
  social and environmental risks as well as benefits that might be associated with
  REDD+ in the country. The SEPC can help to add detail to the broad principles
  set out in the Cancun Agreements, so they could be used by countries as a guide
  during these discussions. <strong>The UN-REDD Programme provides support on the two key
  components of national approaches to safeguards:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Addressing and respecting safeguards through the implementation of
      relevant policies, laws and regulations (PLRs).</strong> These PLRs establish the
      ‘content’ of the safeguards – in other words, national rules for implementation
      of REDD+ activities. Elements that may be of use for developing a coherent set
      of PLRs to address safeguards under REDD+ include a gap analysis to compare
      existing regulations and measures against the country’s needs in terms of
      identified risks and benefits. The UN-REDD Programme Benefits and Risks Tool
      (<a href='/resources/12'>BeRT</a>), which follows the SEPC, can be adapted to assist with such a gap
      analysis in a workshop setting.

      Gaps may then be addressed by creating new, or adapting existing, policies, laws
      and regulations. Should countries find it useful, the outcome of this process
      could be captured in a safeguard policy framework, to provide clarity of how the
      country responds to REDD+ safeguard requirements and objectives.
    </li>
    <li> 
      <strong>Developing a Safeguards Information System (SIS):</strong> A
      safeguards information system providing periodic reports is required under
      UNFCCC. This system should be transparent, consistent, comprehensive and
      effective in informing on how safeguards are addressed and respected.

      SIS should be country-driven, implemented at a national level, and built on
      existing systems, as appropriate. Indicators will need to be developed to
      demonstrate the implementation of national safeguards-relevant policies, laws
      and regulations. A national assessment of existing information sources and
      systems that can provide information on the indicators is likely to be useful.
      Based on this, an assessment can be made regarding what types of new information
      sources and systems need to be developed. The approaches and methodologies
      applied for collection of information should aim to ensure completeness and
      consistency of the information over time and space.
