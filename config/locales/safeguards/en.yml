  In the  &ldquo;Cancun Agreements&rdquo; of 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed a set of social and
  environmental safeguards to be supported and promoted by countries that implement REDD+
  activities. This may require countries to develop new policies, laws and regulations. They also
  agreed that countries should set up a national safeguard information system that is able to
  provide information on how the safeguards are being addressed nationally. Provision of summary
  information on how safeguards are being addressed and respected would be made periodically in
  National Communications to the UNFCCC. Details on such <i>Safeguards Information Systems</i> (SIS) were
  further elaborated at COP 17 in Durban 2011.
</p>

<p>
  There are general steps that can be taken in order to develop country approaches to safeguards, but
  a suitable approach will also depend on national circumstances and governments overall goals for
  the system.
</p>

<p>
  A first and crucial step in developing a REDD+ safeguards approach is to clearly define what is the
  approach is supposed to do. This entails interpreting what is contained in the UNFCCC decisions
  from the country perspective, and considering the specific social and environmental risks as well as
  benefits that might be associated with REDD+ in the country.
</p>

<p>
  The UN-REDD Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria (SEPC) can help to add detail to the
  broad principles set out in the Cancun Agreements, so they could be used by countries as a guide
  during discussions about the goals of national approaches to safeguards.
</p>

<p>
The UN-REDD Programme has developed a set of Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria
(SEPC) as a guiding framework consistent with the Cancun Agreements, to:
  <ol>
    <li>
      To  address social and environmental issues in the UN-REDD National Programmes and other UN-REED founded activities
    </li>
    <li>
      To support countries in developing national approaches to safeguards in line with the decisions made under the UNFCCC
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  For countries that are developing their national approaches to safeguards, UN-REDD currently
  provides support on the two key components that ensure social and environmental risks from
  REDD+ are reduced and that benefits are enhanced:

<ul>
  <li>
    Addressing and respecting safeguards through the implementation of relevant policies,
    laws and regulations (PLRs). These PLRs establish the ‘content’ of the safeguards – in other
    words, national rules for implementation of REDD+ activities. Elements that may be of use
    for developing a coherent set of PLRs to address safeguards under REDD+ include a gap
    analysis to compare existing regulations and measures against the country’s needs in terms
    of identified risks and benefits. The UN-REDD Programme Benefits and Risks Tool (BeRT),
    which follows the SEPC, can be adapted to assist with such a gap analysis in a workshop
    setting. <br>

    Gaps may then be addressed by creating new, or adapting existing, policies, laws and
    regulations. Should countries find it useful, the outcome of this process could be captured
    in a safeguard policy framework, to provide clarity of how the country responds to REDD+
    safeguard requirements and objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a Safeguards Information System (SIS): A safeguards information system providing
    periodic reports is required under UNFCCC. This system should be transparent, consistent,
    comprehensive and effective in informing on how safeguards are addressed and respected.<br>

    SIS should be country-driven, implemented at a national level, and built on existing systems,
    as appropriate. Some form of indicators will need to be developed to demonstrate the
    implementation of national safeguards-relevant policies, laws and regulations. A national
    assessment is likely to be useful, of existing information sources and systems that can
    provide information on the indicators. Based on this, an assessment can be made regarding
    what types of new information sources and systems need to be developed. The approaches
    and methodologies applied for collection of information should aim to ensure completeness
    and consistency of the information over time and space.
  </li>
</ul>

  UN-REDD provides support to countries on both these activities, through direct support as well
  as a number of tools. Resources that are of particular relevance for addressing environmental
  safeguards, have been collected on this website.
